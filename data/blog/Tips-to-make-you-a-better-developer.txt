A few days ago, I came across an article by Simon Holdorf which talked about ways through which you can become a better developer. After I read through it, I thought that I should give you some tips to become a better developer if you are a beginner! Here are few tips that can help you:

1. <h4>Never give up!</h4>

I know when that when you write code for a very long time and then you finally run it, the result as an error. That feeling you get is experienced by everyone. You are not alone, all developers have felt that. Instead of giving up, you should try again and again. You can do it!

2. <h4>Make notes</h4>

Making flash flashcards is the best to remember all the concepts that you have learnt. Since you are learning a language it is best if you make your flash cards online.

3. <h4>Always test your code</h4>

When you are writing code, make sure that you run the code after every interval so that you can the errors you have made and correct them.

4. <h4>Always write comments</h4>

Developers have a habit of writing comments. Writing comments is very useful as when you are writing code, through these comments you can know what function does a code do. It is very useful when you are sharing your code with someone as they will be able to understand the code by reading the comments.

5. <h4>Do more pair programming</h4>

Pair programming is one of the best ways to share knowledge between programmers. You can learn from more experienced developers, or you can help out more junior developers. Either way, itâ€™s a good thing and helps you to stay focused.
