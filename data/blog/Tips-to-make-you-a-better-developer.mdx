A few days ago, I came across an article by Simon Holdorf which talked about ways through which you can become a better developer. After I read through it, I thought that I should give you some tips to become a better developer if you are a beginner! Here are few tips that can help you:

1. <h4>Just start coding</h4>

If you are new to programming, chances are you are overwhelmed by the massive amount of learning materials, and you read post after post, and watch course after course. But with coding, the best approach to learning is actually to just start coding and improve from there.

2. <h4>Never give up!</h4>

I know when that when you write code for a very long time and then you finally run it, the result as an error. That feeling you get is experienced by everyone. You are not alone, all developers have felt that. Instead of giving up, you should try again and again. You can do it!

3. <h4>Make notes</h4>

Making flash flashcards is the best to remember all the concepts that you have learnt. Since you are learning a language it is best if you make your flash cards online.

4. <h4>Always test your code</h4>

When you are writing code, make sure that you run the code after every interval so that you can the errors you have made and correct them.

5. <h4>Always write comments</h4>

Developers have a habit of writing comments. Writing comments is very useful as when you are writing code, through these comments you can know what function does a code do. It is very useful when you are sharing your code with someone as they will be able to understand the code by reading the comments.

6. <h4>Do more pair programming</h4>

Pair programming is one of the best ways to share knowledge between programmers. You can learn from more experienced developers, or you can help out more junior developers. Either way, it’s a good thing and helps you to stay focused.

7. <h4>Don’t hesitate to ask for help</h4>

There’s nothing bad about asking for help. However, it’s always a good practice to try something on your own before asking someone to help you. But in general, if you’re stuck, reach out to someone who can help you.

8. <h4>Join a community</h4>

You don’t have to be a one-person show. Joining a community of like-minded people, other developers, writers, or whatever you have interests in can really help you to improve professionally, discover new opportunities, and even make new friends!

9. <h4>Practice regularly</h4>

You don’t have to be some natural talent to work as a programmer. Almost everything can be learned, and the best way to learn is to program. So write code regularly, daily, and you will automatically become better.

10. <h4>Read books!</h4>

The internet brought us many new opportunities to learn: blogs, podcasts, and video courses. But for me, there is nothing better than a good old paperback book. So if you want to try something old that has worked for generations, read a book.

11. <h4>Contribute to Stack Overflow</h4>

Stack Overflow is one of the largest developer communities, and you can find solutions for almost any programming problem there. But instead of just reading, you could try raising questions or answering questions from others. Remember, giving is better than receiving.

12. <h4>Take some time off</h4>

Coding is a fulfilling thing for me. If I’m “in the flow,” hours are flying by like there is no tomorrow. Sometimes I code during work hours, continue in my free time, and do it even on weekends. But this can quickly lead to burnout or stress, so it’s really healthy to take a few hours or whole days off programming to recharge the batteries. Otherwise, you can use pomodoro timers if you consider productivity!

13. <h4>Track your progress</h4>

“If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.” If you think you haven’t made enough progress (or any progress at all), it might be time to start tracking your progress. Commits, lines of codes, courses, books, certifications — just track them.

14. <h4>Take advantage of free resources</h4>

There are many great resources available for learning any programming topic or web development, but sometimes it’s hard to separate the good ones from the bad. Ask friends, ask co-workers, or go on social media for recommendations. Look at the number of views on YouTube, for example. But don’t follow blindly; always reflect on what you read or watch. Personally I would recommend [Freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), its open-source and free!

15. <h4>Stay humble</h4>

Don’t take things for granted or make fun of others who are just at the beginning of their careers. We all started somewhere and wished we had cool people to back us up back then.

Not everything will be relevant for you or apply to your current situation, but I hope you can get something out of this list. Let’s help each other as a community!
