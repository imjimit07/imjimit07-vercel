High School life is one of the most important part of our life when it involves an student studying in an **Indian curriculum**. When that part of your life is over and you are in college, some call that life good and many call it bad. When you study in a education system that requires you to rote knowledge from tons of books rather understanding its use in real life situations and applying practically, you realize how far behind you are compared to other students who study in a different education system.

I, Jimit Patel, being a high school Science student, personally think that high school is one of the most challenging part of an Indian student's life. This part of your life will mostly affect your future when it comes to getting a good college, a job, salary, etc.

When you start high school, in the first few weeks, you realize that the techniques that you used to study subjects in middle school don't apply the same way in high school. In Grade 9 and Grade 10, I realized that the Mathematics taught in Grade 8 was nothing compared to Grade 9 and Grade 10. Problems became more complex and required more time to think rather than calculating the actual answer.

When you come to Grade 11, and you have taken Science as your stream, within just 2 months at least 5 students will change to Commerce. Science stream includes core subjects like Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Many people in Grade 10, when they are choosing to take Biology and not Mathematics, they think that they won't have to solve numericals. But the funny part is that Mathematics is backbone of Science. Most students tend to start studying for JEE or NEET exams which they would give 2 years later.

When you start studying for any of these two exams, remember 1 thing:

> Even if you work hard for JEE or NEET, it doesn't mean that you will make it to IIT or AIMS respectively.

This lesson is realized by more than 15 lakh students every year once they apply for college in India. I myself didn't get IIT after I gave JEE in March 2025. JEE is known as one of the most toughest examinations around the world. It is ranked 2nd as the most difficult exam after GAOKAO in China. It is given by at least 15 lakh (1.5 million) students every year and it keeps on increasing as time passes by. The papers are made by different IITs every year. Questions in this exam are known to make students go under high amounts of stress during preparation and exam for 2 years continuously.

> Every second *counts*.

But there are many effects of giving this exam. Due to the compitition in this exam, students stay in their rooms studying day and night. Many parents send students to boarding schools for 2 years. The JEE coaching industry is a multi-billion dollar industry due to the high amount of students giving this exam. Many coaching institues are also not good. Teachers trouble studens, make fun of them and do whatever it takes to scare the student.

I myself experienced it. In my Grade 11 final JEE mock exam, I didn't prepare and I went to give the exam. Instead of taking 3 hours to finish the exam I took 40 minutes and submitted it. My Mathematics teacher was pissed due to my low performance and complained to my parents about it. He also told lies that I was sleeping in the class and distracting other students. He also told that I wouldn't get 90 percentile in Mathematics in JEE the following year. He said all of this in front of other parents. My parents being ashamed and angry took me home and scolded me. Out of anger, I took a serious promise that I prove my teacher wrong in the real JEE exam. I made my own teacher as an enemy. I studied from 2 hours a day to 4 hours a day. I knew in Grade 11 that I don't have the capability to get into IIT as it was too late. With only a year left for the exam I studied Grade 11 and Grade 12 along with my school homework which had practicals, projects, etc. 

In 2025, I got 89.9 percentile in Mathematics and 82 percentile overall. Though it was not good marks for everyone else, I knew, **I won**.

But when I saw the JEE topper, I feel sorry for him. If you look at the behaviour of that student, you would see that he is behaving like a robot. He lost his childhood, lost contact with his family and friends, has become the most introverted person due to stress and pressure. Other than studying, he doesn't know anything. There is sadness behind the smile, he puts on his face. While people around him are celebrating, he is not. He has no childhood left at that point.

I had started watching Formula 1 in 2018. Max Verstappen and late Niki Lauda are my role models. Max Verstappen's childhood and my childhood had a lot of similarities. Both of us had a strict upbringing. Whether it was in racing or studying JEE. In 2024, I saw a movie called *Rush* which was the story of the rivalry of Niki Lauda and James Hunt. From that movie, I heard an important quote by Niki:

> A wise man learns more from his enemies than a fool from his friends....People always think of us as rivals. But he was among the very few I liked, and even fewer that I respected. He remains the only person I envied.

I would like inform the reader that *sometimes life cannot go the way you expect*. Many students dream of going to IIT or AIMS, but only a *handful* are able to get a seat into these colleges. That is why it is important to have contact with your family but also important to study. You shouldn't go away from your family to study for an entire day that will only get you a single sheet of paper, that is, the marks.

> Choose your life choices *wisely*.

When I came to college, I took Computer Science as my major. Out of 80 students in my class, only a handful knew the basics of Computer Science. So, as I said before, choose wisely. If you are taking Computer Science in college, take Computer Science in high school also. This applies for all majors.
