Hello everyone, and a very Happy New Year! 2022 was the year of cats.  cat memes that went viral such as Scaredy Cat (The picture given above). These cats have now come to Chess.com Last year people madeas bots to play chess. They had released 5 cat bots for playing:
1. Scaredy Cat (800)
2. Angry Cat (1000)
3. Mr. Grumpers (1200)
4. Catspurrov (1400)
5. Mittens (1)

Wait a minute, Mittens is having playing strength as 1? Yep, thats right! But please, don't judge a book by its cover. Mittens might look weak but it is the most aggressive chess bot ever made by Chess.com. If you go to Chess.com you will see that Mittens looks like this:

According to IM Levy Rozman from GothamChess, he quoted:

> Chess.com spawned one of the most evil beings ever created in chess, its a cat and its ELO is literally 1 and yet it can beat all of the strongest grandmasters in the world.

I have played this bot many times, it plays too accurate for its appearence. My confidence was destroyed. I thought to quit chess (just joking!). Here a 2 games I played with Mittens
Here I play as White. Check it out:

Mittens plays the Queen's Gambit. Also the way it talk is terrifying.

Here is the other game I play as Black. Mittens plays the Queen's Gambit.:

Here are a few quotes said by Mittens while playing:

> Meow. I am become Mittens, the destroyer of kings. Hehehe.

NO. You are not. I am and my older brother is. My older brother is Stockfish.

> *ominously* All chess players eventually crumble under my mighty pawsâ€¦I mean, meow! Hehehe.

Who wrote this?

> *Knocks queen onto the floor* Your queen is gone. Hehehehe.

Yours is also gone. (Second game above)

Here are quotes said by other cat bots:

1. Scaredy Cat (800)

> If I purr and act cute, will you let me win?
> Nice and slow...

No. But I have some milk if you want.

2. Angry Cat (1000)

> *hisses* Chess bad, relaxing good! Meow.

Well I agree with you.

3. Mr. Grumpers (1200)

> I'd rather be playing with the box where the chess pieces came in, but I guess we can play chess, too.

Mr. Grumpers more like Mr. Grumpers the Grinch LOL. You sound like my sister.

4. Catspurrov (1400)

> *Hissing Noises*

Thats how we feel when we lose at chess.

Other cat bots play normally. I was able to defeat Angry Cat (1000 ELO) and Mr. Grumpers (1200 ELO) easily. If you are a Chess.com user, you would have known that Chess.com bots are very easy to defeat. Me being a 600 ELO player, defeated Emir 3 times who is a bot of 1000 ELO. This is the first bot which is UNBEATABLE! Even Grandmasters where not being able to defeat it.
But the question is CAN MITTENS DEFEAT STOCKFISH 15?

Well according to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3zCpRDaIA) below made by GothamChess (IM Levy Rozman) Stockfish defeated Mittens while as both White and Black. The game was nuts!

I literally bowed down to Stockfish after watching this video. Amazing match!
ALL HAIL THE KING OF CHESS ENGINES STOCKFISH!
