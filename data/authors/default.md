I'm a Creative Developer from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, learning software development and web development. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.

I was born at 23rd September 2007 in Mumbai, India. Currently, I am staying in Dubai and enjoy the life at my best. I play games in my free time. I also play keyboard and do some programming.

Computer Applications is my favourite subject in school. I like to solve complex problems whenever I get free time. I love playing cricket and [chess](https://lichess.org/@/imjimit07). I am a aviation enthusiast.

My aim to make websites and softwares that are functional and user-friendly. Moreover, I add personal touch to my products and make sure that is eye-catching and easy to use.
